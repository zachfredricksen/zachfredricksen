# About Me
Hi, I’m Zach Fredricksen.  
I've been a full-stack developer in the past.  
Currently, I'm developing my portfolio and applying for jobs in the Northwest Arkansas area.  
  
My main focus with my LLC, Ghostbag Studio, is to create a mobile game that maximizes insight data and delivers compelling experiences with a F2P revenue model.  
I am working with Unreal Engine 5, Blender, Quixel Suite, Epic Online Services, JetBrains Rider, and Reason to make the game.  
  
In addition to full-stack application development and game development, I am interested in voice applications (Alexa and Google Assistant), machine learning, cloud applications, and analytics.  
  
I enjoy disc golf, games (current game is Elden Ring, always playing Teamfight Tactics), hiking, and I am developing a hobby of writing (short stories, novella, novel, screenplay formats).
